The Instrument Simulator
========================

Running the Instrument Simulator
--------------------------------

The end product of a mock observation is a "standard" event file which has been 
convolved with a model for the telescope. In SOXS, this is handled by the
instrument simulator. 

:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` reads in a SIMPUT catalog and creates a
standard event file using the instrument simulator. :func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`
performs the following actions:

1. Uses the effective area curve to determine which events will actually be detected.
2. Projects these events onto the detector plane and perform PSF blurring and dithering 
   of their positions.
3. Add particle/instrumental and astrophysical background events.
4. Convolves the event energies with the response matrix to produce channels.
5. Writes everything to an event file.

All of the photon lists in the SIMPUT catalog will be processed. A typical invocation of 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` looks like the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import instrument_simulator
    simput_file = "snr_simput.fits" # SIMPUT file to be read
    out_file = "evt_mucal.fits" # event file to be written
    exp_time = 30000. # The exposure time in seconds
    instrument = "mucal" # short name for instrument to be used
    sky_center = [30., 45.] # RA, Dec of pointing in degrees
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center, clobber=True)
 
The ``clobber`` argument allows an existing file to be overwritten. Instruments must exist
in the instrument registry, unless you have your own JSON-based instrument specification, 
which you can then supply as the instrument argument instead:

.. code-block:: python

    instrument = "my_imager.json"
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, instrument, sky_center, clobber=True)

Available instruments are:

* ``"hdxi"``: Nominal configuration for the High Definition X-ray Imager
* ``"mucal"``: Nominal configuration for the microcalorimeter

You can also change other aspects of the observation with :func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`. 
For example, you can change the shape and size of the dither pattern. The default dither pattern is a 
square of width 16.0 arcseconds on a side. You can change it to be a circle dither pattern or turn off
dithering entirely:

.. code-block:: python

    # this invocation makes the dither shape a circle and sets the radius to 8 arcsec
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, dither_shape="circle", 
                         dither_size=8.0)
    
.. code-block:: python

    # this invocation turns off dithering entirely
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, dither_shape=None) 

You can also specify a non-zero roll angle:

.. code-block:: python

    # adds a roll of 45.0 degrees
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, roll_angle=45.0) 

The particle background scale can be set using the ``instr_bkgnd_scale`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

    # decreases the particle background intensity by half
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, instr_bkgnd_scale=0.5) 

The astrophysical background/foreground can be changed by setting the ``astro_bkgnd`` argument. 
This corresponds to the name of a stored background in the background registry (see 
:ref:`background` for more information on how to create, store, and access new astrophysical 
backgrounds). 

.. code-block:: python

    # uses the default astrophysical background
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, astro_bkgnd="hm_cxb")
                          
.. code-block:: python

    # turns off the astrophysical background entirely
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, astro_bkgnd=None)

.. _instrument-registry:

Creating New Instrument Specifications
--------------------------------------

SOXS provides the ability to customize the models of the different components of X-ray Surveyor being
simulated. This is provided by the use of the instrument registry and JSON files which contain prescriptions
for different instrument configurations.

The Instrument Registry
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The instrument registry is simply a Python dictionary containing various instrument specifications. You
can see the contents of the instrument registry by calling :func:`~soxs.instrument.show_instrument_registry`:

.. code-block:: python

    import soxs
    soxs.show_instrument_registry()

gives (showing only a subset for brevity):

.. code-block:: pycon

    Instrument: hdxi
        num_pixels: 4096
        plate_scale: 0.3333333333333333
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: hdxi
        arf: xrs_hdxi_3x10.arf
        rmf: xrs_hdxi.rmf
    Instrument: mucal
        num_pixels: 300
        plate_scale: 1.0
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: mucal
        arf: xrs_mucal_3x10.arf
        rmf: xrs_mucal.rmf
    Instrument: mucal_3x15
        num_pixels: 300
        plate_scale: 1.0
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: mucal
        arf: xrs_mucal_3x15.arf
        rmf: xrs_mucal.rmf
    Instrument: hdxi_3x15
        num_pixels: 4096
        plate_scale: 0.3333333333333333
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: hdxi
        arf: xrs_hdxi_3x15.arf
        rmf: xrs_hdxi.rmf
    Instrument: hdxi_3x10
        num_pixels: 4096
        plate_scale: 0.3333333333333333
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: hdxi
        arf: xrs_hdxi_3x10.arf
        rmf: xrs_hdxi.rmf
 
You can see there are currently two base instruments, ``"hdxi"`` and ``"mucal"``, with variations on
the ARF. The various parts of each instrument specification are:

* ``"name"``: The name of the instrument specification. 
* ``"arf"``: The file containing the ARF.
* ``"num_pixels"``: The number of resolution elements on a side of the field of view.
* ``"bkgnd"``: The name of the instrumental background to use, stored in the background registry
  (see :ref:`background` for more details).
* ``"psf"``: The PSF specification to use. At time of writing, the only one available is that of
  a Gaussian PSF, with a single parameter, the FWHM of the PSF. This is specified using a Python 
  list, e.g. ``["gaussian", 0.5]``
* ``"rmf"``: The file containing the RMF.
* ``"plate_scale"``: The arcseconds per resolution element (pixel). 

As SOXS matures, this list of specifications will likely expand, and the number of options for 
some of them (e.g., the PSF) will also expand.

Making Custom Instruments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make a custom instrument, you can take an existing instrument specification and modify it, giving
it a new name, or write a new specification to a `JSON <http://www.json.org>`_ file and read it in. To
make a new specification from a dictionary, construct the dictionary and feed it to 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.add_instrument_to_registry`. For example, if you wanted to take the default 
calorimeter specification and change the plate scale, you would do it this way, using 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.get_instrument_from_registry` to get the specification so that you can alter it:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import get_instrument_from_registry, add_instrument_to_registry
    new_mucal = get_instrument_from_registry("mucal")
    new_mucal["name"] = "mucal_high_res" # Must change the name, otherwise an error will be thrown
    new_mucal["plate_scale"] = 0.1 # Ambitiously smaller plate scale, 0.1 arcsec per pixel
    name = add_instrument_to_registry(new_mucal)
    
You can also store an instrument specification in a JSON file and import it:

.. code-block:: python

    name = add_instrument_to_registry("my_mucal.json")
    
You can download an example instrument specification JSON file `here <../example_mucal_spec.json>`_. 

You can also take an existing instrument specification and write it to a JSON file for editing
using :func:`~soxs.instrument.write_instrument_json`:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import write_instrument_json
    # Using the "new_mucal" from above
    write_instrument_json("mucal_high_res", "mucal_high_res.json")

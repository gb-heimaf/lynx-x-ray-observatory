General Information Regarding the Command-Line Interface to SOXS
================================================================

.. _cmd-response-path:

Path to the Response Files
--------------------------

To use either the ``instrument_simulator`` or ``simulate_spectrum`` command-line
scripts, it is necessary to download the response files from the :ref:`responses` 
page and place them in an appropriate location, of which there are two. The first 
is simply to place the response files needed for the instrument simulator in the 
current working directory from which you run SOXS. However, it is probably more
convenient to place the response files in a default path, which can be specified 
in the SOXS configuration file like this:

.. code-block:: text

    [soxs]
    response_path = /Users/jzuhone/Data/soxs_responses

.. _cmd-units:

Special Argument Handling for Quantities with Units
---------------------------------------------------

Many arguments in the command line scripts which have units can 
take a special format which allows one to specify that particular
quantity in the units desired by the user. For example, the 
:ref:`cmd-make-point-source` script has the arguments ``exp_time``
and ``area``, which assume the default units of seconds and :math:`\rm{cm^2}`,
respectively, if one supplies floating-point numbers:

.. code-block:: bash

    [~]$ make_point_source pt_src src1 20.0 -32.0 pt_src_spectrum.dat 100000.0 --overwrite --area=30000.0

but can take other units, like ks and :math:`\rm{m^2}`, in this format:

.. code-block:: bash

    [~]$ make_point_source pt_src src1 20.0 -32.0 pt_src_spectrum.dat 100.0,ks --overwrite --area=3.0,m**2

Since the quantities are the same but in different units, these two calls would
be equivalent. 

The following arguments used in the command line scripts accept values with a 
unit specification:

Random Number Generation
------------------------

Many routines in SOXS require generating random numbers for energies, sky
positions, spectral channels, etc. By default, for every SOXS run this will
be a different set of random numbers. It is often the case, however, that one
wants to use a consistent, repeatable set of random numbers to reproduce results
exactly. For this, many of the command-line scripts in SOXS take a 
``random_seed`` optional argument, which has a default of ``None``, but if set 
to an integer will use this value as a random seed. 

For example, to use a consistent random seed in generating positions and
energies for an annulus source, one would set the random seed
like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    make_annulus_source my_cat annulus 30.0 45.0 10.0 30.0 thermal_spec.dat 100.0,ks --random_seed=24

Check the documentation for the various command line scripts to see which
functions have the ``random_seed`` argument.

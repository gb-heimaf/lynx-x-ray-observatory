We've chosen these numbers so that the spectrum has an energy resolution of about 1 eV. Setting `thermal_broad=True` turns on thermal broadening. This simulation does not include metallicity, so we'll do something simple and say that it uses the above spectral model and the metallicity is a constant $Z = 0.3~Z_\\odot$:"
